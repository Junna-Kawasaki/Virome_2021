# Virome_phylogenetic_analyses  

## Descriptions  
There are two types of exapmles: Goat hepatovirus and Macaque MLB-like astroviruses.    

1. The program: **Goat_hepatovirus/Virome_phylogenetic_analysis_ICTV_batch.sh**, provides an example to construct a phylogenetic tree using the reference file provided by the ICTV resources.  
- Output file is **output_examples/**.  

2. The program: **Macaque_MLB_like_astrovirus/Virome_phylogenetic_analysis_Refseq_batch.sh**, provides an example to construct a phylogenetic tree using the reference file provided by the ICTV resources.  
- Output file is **output_examples/**.  

## Data  
The treefile constructed by IQTREE are present in **Other_tree_files**.  
- Figure_4B  
The fasta and treefile were used for constructing tree of the family Hepeviridae.  

- Figure_4D  
The fasta and treefile were used for constructing tree of the genus Parechovirus in the family Picornaviridae.  

- Figure_4E  
The fasta and treefile were used for constructing tree of the genus Pegivirus in the family Flaviviridae.
