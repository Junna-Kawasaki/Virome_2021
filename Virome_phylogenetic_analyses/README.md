# Virome_phylogenetic_analyses  

**  **
## Descriptions  
The program: **Goat_hepatovirus/Virome_phylogenetic_analysis_ICTV_batch.sh**, provides an example to construct a phylogenetic tree using the reference file provided by the ICTV resources.  
- Output file is **output_examples/OPSR.Pic.Fig4A.v8_P1-147.add.out.fasta.treefile**.  

**  **
## Data  
The fasta file used for phylogenetic analysis and treefile constructed by IQTREE are present in **Other_tree_files**.  
- Figure_4B  
The fasta and treefile were used for constructing tree of the family *Hepeviridae*.  

- Figure_4C  
The fasta and treefile were used for constructing tree of the family *Astroviridae*.  

- Figure_4D  
The fasta and treefile were used for constructing tree of the genus *Parechovirus* in the family *Picornaviridae*.  

- Figure_4E  
The fasta and treefile were used for constructing tree of the genus *Pegivirus* in the family *Flaviviridae*.
